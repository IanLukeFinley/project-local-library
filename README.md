# project-local-library

An initial large project for my Thinkful training.  

The project was to build on HTML provided by Thinkful and provide the necessary functions to sort data for a local library.

The functions are able to return several pieces of data: what books are checked out, and by whom; which books and authors are most popular; who wrote which books, and how many books a given person has checked out.

The primary purpose of this project was to demonstrate facility with large data sets, particularly using array functions like filter(), map(), forEach, and reduce()

As a training project, I don't see much future development for this project, but I have used existing pieces of the code as a template for other projects that do similar sorting.
